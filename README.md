AI Classification Internship Progress

This repository contains work focused on handling and classifying unstructured data with AI/ML tools.

### Dataset
- `large_unstructured_sensitive_data.pdf`: A synthetic dataset with 5000 entries simulating personal and sensitive data (PII, PHI, PCI) generated using the Faker Python library.

### Goals
- Practice sensitive data detection and classification
- Work with unstructured documents (PDFs)
- Explore AWS SageMaker and LLaMA4 for real-world ML pipelines

> All data is synthetic and safe for public research.
